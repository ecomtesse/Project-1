## Introduction

This game was developed as an initial project in completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course. I was allocated four days to develop the game based on the [brief](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir59anz/seir59anz-course-materials/tree/main/unit1/project) provided.

The project provided the first opportunity to apply the theortical skills I learnt in the first two weeks of the course into a practical application.

## Game Development

The application uses:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

The fireworks feature was developed based on the YouTube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyV84tYmiQ8). It is contained with the <code>fireworks.js</code> file. The fireworks was seperated from the rest of the javascript to improve readability of each file and to seperate my code from what is primarily someone else's code.

## About the Game

It's tic tac toe... or noughts and crosess... or Xs and Os, depending on where you're from. If you've somehow managed to get through life without ever playing it until now, you can find more information on the game and its rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

There is a restart game button after the game has ended. Please note that whoever had the final turn on the last game, the other player will have the first turn on the next game.

The game includes audio, so headphones/speakers on for the best experience.

## Future Updates

Potential future updates for the game may include:
- an AI mode to enable single player gameplay
- a 5 x 5 square grid
- toggle switch to turn audio on and off
